# colour

i chose these colour scheme because of my Research i have seen a few websites use a type of blue colour and i think it works great with a website about phones and also i chose these colour because they are eye catching but not to bright. i also chose this because of colour blind people.

first colour pallet [Pallet 1](https://paletton.com/#uid=a3+4B1ksutJhCBymDvauynIzSiIku2kglOrHr1otAGfRM6at)

* primary colour

    * .color-primary-0 { color: #2828A6 }	
    * .color-primary-1 { color: #6767C2 }
    * .color-primary-2 { color: #4545AE }
    * .color-primary-3 { color: #191984 }
    * .color-primary-4 { color: #0E0E68 }

* complementary colour 

    * .color-complement-0 { color: #420E6D }	
    * .color-complement-1 { color: #6A3694 }
    * .color-complement-2 { color: #551C83 }
    * .color-complement-3 { color: #310555 }
    * .color-complement-4 { color: #200238 }

i will be using primary colour 0 for the navigation bar and i will be using the primary colour 2 for the phone list drop list. i will also be using the complementary colour 0 for links i have been on before and the links i am on right now.the text will be all black.

second colour pallet [Pallet 2](https://paletton.com/#uid=a3+3l1ktBohv57yuxgPtpxMq6KpkCczknzKZsTG6A6poBJjg)

    * .color-primary-0 { color: #e61b00 }
    * .color-primary-1 { color: #ff452c }
    * .color-primary-2 { color: #ff2407 }
    * .color-primary-3 { color: #b51500 }
    * .color-primary-4 { color: #840f00 }

*  complementary colour 

    * .color-complement-0 { color: #8a0070 }
    * .color-complement-1 { color: #dc00b2 }
    * .color-complement-2 { color: #ac008b }
    * .color-complement-3 { color: #6c0057 }
    * .color-complement-4 { color: #3f0033 }


for my second pallet i will use the same as the first one but i will make the dropdown box that your on complementary colour 2 so you know where you are.

# fonts

[font 1](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt?category=Serif,Sans+Serif#standard-styles) Prompt, Regular 400

font-family: 'Prompt', sans-serif;

![Font 1](../../src/img/PromptFont1.png)

i will use the first font for heading/subheadings mainly. i chose this font because is very similar to the regular one and a lot of websites use the regular font so i think it will work well with my website.



[font 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro?category=Serif,Sans+Serif)

font-family: 'Crimson Pro', serif;

![Font 2](../../src/img/PromptFont2.png)

i will use my second font as the main one for writing. the reason i used this font is because very similar to the regular but a bit more fancy so i am sure that this will work well as the main font.

# design

I did some research on some phone company's and with the information I have gathered from then I have made two layouts for my website both using different colour scheme. 
# layout 1

![storyboard 1](../../src/img/StoryBoard.png)

I have started by using the colour (color primary 2) and (color complement 2) for the logo, (color primary 2) for the text, (color complement 2) for the banner and then i used (color primary 0) for the nav bar, (color primary 1) for the ad part and (color primary 3) for the center box.I ended up scraping this layout and using the second one instead. 

## colour


With the research i did i have chosen a colour scheme to go with the first layout i have chosen this colour scheme because i have realized that a lot of phone company's make there web pages a type of blue colour. the blue i used is an eye caching colour and its also easy on colour blind people.

first colour scheme 

![Pallet 1](../../src/img/Pallet1.png)

* primary colour

    * .color-primary-0 { color: #2828A6 }	
    * .color-primary-1 { color: #6767C2 }
    * .color-primary-2 { color: #4545AE }
    * .color-primary-3 { color: #191984 }
    * .color-primary-4 { color: #0E0E68 }

* complementary colour 

    * .color-complement-0 { color: #420E6D }	
    * .color-complement-1 { color: #6A3694 }
    * .color-complement-2 { color: #551C83 }
    * .color-complement-3 { color: #310555 }
    * .color-complement-4 { color: #200238 }





# layout 2

![storyboard 2](../../src/img/StoryBoard2.png)

I have started by using the colour (color primary 3) and (color complement 3) for the logo,and then i used (color primary 2) for the nav bar, (color complement 3)for the ad part and (color primary 3) for the center box.

## colour 

for my second layout i have chosen this colour scheme because these two colour work well together and its not to much, it also well for colour blind people and it makes the text stand out more.

![Pallet 1](../../src/img/Pallet2.png)

* primary colour

    * .color-primary-0 { color: #e61b00 }
    * .color-primary-1 { color: #ff452c }
    * .color-primary-2 { color: #ff2407 }
    * .color-primary-3 { color: #b51500 }
    * .color-primary-4 { color: #840f00 }

*  complementary colour 

    * .color-complement-0 { color: #8a0070 }
    * .color-complement-1 { color: #dc00b2 }
    * .color-complement-2 { color: #ac008b }
    * .color-complement-3 { color: #6c0057 }
    * .color-complement-4 { color: #3f0033 }

When you click on the log in button it will come up with not implemented and i have not added that feature. both the page and the phone list will be scrollable, you will have to click image for it to send you to the phones about page.
